- **Annualized Volatility:** 3.81%

### ⚖️ **Risk Metrics**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.499
- **Maximum Drawdown:** -4.42%
- **Win Rate:** 56.2% (positive months)
- **Best Month:** +5.74% return
- **Worst Month:** -4.25% return

### 🎯 **Model Performance**
- **Average Hit Rate:** 7.8% (overlap between predicted and actual top 5)
- **Total Months Analyzed:** 242
- **Factors Analyzed:** 83
- **Average Training Time:** 0.81 seconds per month

## 🔧 **METHODOLOGY CORRECTIONS APPLIED**

### ✅ **Fixed Training Issues**
1. **Eliminated validation splits** within 60-month training windows
2. **Corrected to use ALL 60 months** for training each model
3. **Fixed random seed issues** for reproducible results
4. **Resolved device conflicts** in parallel processing

### ✅ **Data Quality Assurance**
- Validated data alignment between forecast and actual return files
- Ensured consistent factor naming and date ranges
- Confirmed no missing values in critical periods
- Verified decimal vs percentage interpretation

### ✅ **Performance Validation**
- Realistic return expectations (1.90% annual vs impossible 190%)
- Modest hit rates consistent with factor selection difficulty
- Reasonable volatility and drawdown levels
- Proper benchmark comparisons
